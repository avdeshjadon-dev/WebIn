## üöÄ Getting Started

You can get WebIn up and running in two ways: by cloning the repository (for developers) or by loading the unpacked extension (for users).

### 1. For Developers (Cloning the Repo)

This method is recommended if you want to contribute to the project or explore the code.

1.  **Clone the repository:** Open your terminal and run the following command:
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/avdeshjadon-dev/WebIn.git](https://github.com/avdeshjadon-dev/WebIn.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```sh
    cd WebIn
    ```
3.  **Load the extension in Chrome:**
    * Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
    * Enable **"Developer mode"** using the toggle in the top-right corner.
    * Click the **"Load unpacked"** button.
    * Select the `WebIn` folder that you just cloned.

### 2. For General Users (Recommended)

This is the simplest way to install and use the extension.

1.  **Download the ZIP file:** Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/avdeshjadon-dev/WebIn/releases) of this repository and download the latest `.zip` file.
2.  **Unzip the file:** Extract the contents of the ZIP file into a permanent folder on your computer.
3.  **Load the extension in Chrome:**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architectural Overview

WebIn is built with a clear separation of concerns to ensure it is robust and easy to maintain.

### 1. `manifest.json`
This is the heart of the extension. It uses Manifest V3 and defines:
* **`permissions`**: Requests access to `storage` (to save user data) and `scripting` (to inject the UI).
* **`background`**: Registers `background.js` as the service worker.
* **`action`**: Defines the toolbar icon and enables the extension to be triggered by a user click.
* **`host_permissions`**: Although not strictly necessary for this logic to run on an active tab click, it's good practice for future features.

### 2. `background.js` (Service Worker)
The background script is an event-based service worker. Its primary responsibility is to handle tasks that don't require a visible UI.
* **Icon Fetching:** It listens for messages from `inject.js` requesting a favicon. To avoid CORS issues and get a clean, usable image, it fetches the icon URL and converts it to a `base64` data URL, which is then sent back to the content script.

### 3. `inject.js` (UI & Core Logic)
This is the largest and most critical file. It's injected into the active tab when the user clicks the extension icon. The entire script is wrapped in an **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)** to prevent any variable leakage into the global scope of the web page.

* **State Management:**
    * Two variables, `tabs` and `tabContent`, hold the entire state of the application.
    * `saveState()` and `initializeApp()` functions handle the serialization/deserialization of this state to and from `chrome.storage.local`.

* **UI Construction (`buildUI`)**:
    * **Shadow DOM:** The entire UI is rendered inside a Shadow DOM to guarantee that no CSS from the host page can affect the extension, and vice-versa. This is critical for consistent behavior across all websites.
    * **Programmatic Element Creation:** Every single UI element is created and configured dynamically using JavaScript. This provides full control over the structure and behavior of the application without needing a separate HTML file.

* **Event Handling:**
    * **Drag & Resize:** Listeners are attached to the header and resizer handle to allow the user to move and resize the main window. The position and size are not currently saved but could be a future enhancement.
    * **User Actions:** All clicks on tabs, cards, search, and action buttons (`Add`, `Delete`, `Reset`) are handled with dedicated event listeners that update the state and re-render the UI as needed.

* **Modals:** A flexible `showModal()` system is used to generate different types of dialogs (confirm, prompt, edit forms) dynamically, improving code reuse and user experience.
